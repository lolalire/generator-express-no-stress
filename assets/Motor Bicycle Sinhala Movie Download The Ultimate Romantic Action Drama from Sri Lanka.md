## The Plot
 
The film begins with Amila narrating his life story and his love for cinema. He lives with his mother (Jayakody), who works as a domestic helper for a rich family. He works as a delivery boy for a grocery store, and spends his free time watching movies and making short films with his friends. He meets Sandali at a film festival, where they bond over their mutual interest in cinema. They start dating secretly, as Sandali's father is very strict and conservative. He does not approve of Amila's background or his career choice.
 
Amila decides to buy a motor bicycle to impress Sandali and her father, hoping that they will accept him as a suitable partner for her. He borrows money from a loan shark and buys a second-hand bike from a garage. However, he soon realizes that the bike belongs to Konda, a notorious gangster who is looking for it. Konda and his men start chasing Amila and threaten him to return the bike or pay a huge amount of money. Amila tries to hide the bike and avoid Konda, but he gets into more trouble as he also has to deal with the loan shark and Sandali's father.
 
The film reaches its climax when Amila decides to take Sandali on a trip to Nuwara Eliya, a scenic hill station in Sri Lanka. He hopes to propose to her there and elope with her. However, Konda finds out about their plan and follows them with his men. He confronts Amila at a hotel and demands the bike back. A fight ensues between them, which ends with Konda shooting Amila in the chest. Sandali screams in horror as she sees Amila falling to the ground.
 
The film ends with a twist, revealing that the whole story was actually a script written by Amila for his first feature film. He is shown lying on a hospital bed, recovering from a gunshot wound that he received during a robbery at his workplace. He tells his mother that he has sold his script to a famous director, who has agreed to make it into a film. He also tells her that Sandali is his girlfriend, who is waiting for him outside. He says that he will buy a motor bicycle for her once he gets well. The film ends with Amila smiling and looking at the camera.

## How to Create a Mobile Map from ArcGIS
 
To create a mobile map from ArcGIS, you need to use CarryMap Builder. CarryMap Builder is an extension for ArcGIS Desktop that adds a new toolbar and menu to the ArcGIS interface. You can use it to convert any ArcGIS map document (.mxd) or layer file (.lyr) into a mobile map (.cmf2).
 
To create a mobile map from ArcGIS, follow these steps:

1. Open ArcGIS Desktop and load the map document or layer file that you want to convert.
2. Click on the CarryMap Builder toolbar and select "Create Mobile Map".
3. A new window will open where you can configure the settings for your mobile map. You can choose the name, description, output folder, scale range, coordinate system, encryption, compression, and other options for your mobile map.
4. Click on "Create" to start the conversion process. Depending on the size and complexity of your original data, this may take some time.
5. When the conversion is finished, you will see a message that says "Mobile map created successfully". You can click on "Open Folder" to locate your mobile map file (.cmf2) in the output folder.

## How to Customize and Optimize Your Mobile Map
 
After creating your mobile map, you may want to customize and optimize it further. You can use CarryMap Builder to edit your mobile map and change its appearance, functionality, and performance. You can also add additional features such as bookmarks, search fields, labels, hyperlinks, attachments, etc.
 
To customize and optimize your mobile map, follow these steps:

1. Open CarryMap Builder and click on "Open Mobile Map". Browse to the folder where you saved your mobile map file (.cmf2) and select it.
2. A new window will open where you can see the preview of your mobile map. You can use the tools on the left panel to edit your mobile map. For example, you can:
    - Add or remove layers from your mobile map
    - Change the symbology, transparency, visibility, order, or name of your layers
    - Add or remove bookmarks from your mobile map
    - Add or remove search fields from your mobile map
    - Add or remove labels from your layers
    - Add or remove hyperlinks from your features
    - Add or remove attachments from your features
    - Change the properties of your mobile map
